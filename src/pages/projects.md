## React Json Viewer component

**Source code**: [GitHub](https://github.com/AnyRoad/react-json-view-lite)

React component to display formatted JSON data. Many other libraries shows very slow performance
while rendering few megabytes data or fast enough but just render JSON without any extra features, even ability to expand or collapse nested objects.

This implementation aims to render high volume input data but still have few usefull customizations like chaning styles and ability to expand/collapse nested objects.

Example can be found [here](/tools/json-view).
