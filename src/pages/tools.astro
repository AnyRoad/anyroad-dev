  <p class='mb-5'>
    These are small dev tools I've created cause I found them practical in my daily work. They all work only
    on the client-side and do not send any requests to any server except the APIs needed for the logic itself.
    If you found any issue, please report it
    <a href='http://github.com/AnyRoad/anyroad-dev/issues'>here</a>.
